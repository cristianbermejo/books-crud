Microservice made during the `Spring Boot y Spring Cloud: arquitectura de microservicios en la nube` course on [TrainingIT](https://www.trainingit.es/).

Note: Switch to the `feature/database` branch to see the version of this project that uses a MySQL database to interact with the data.

## What I've learned

- Using Spring Tools 4 to create a Spring project.
- Using annotations to create controllers and handler methods.
- Using properties for customizing the project's settings.
- Make handler methods that returns JSON data.
